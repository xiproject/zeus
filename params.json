{"name":"Zeus","tagline":"a distributed personal assistant for hackers","body":"### Introduction\r\nZeus is your personal assistant. He answers your questions, plays music, helps you get stuff done, and much more. He runs on your computer, understanding your behaviour and adapting to it. Best of all, he's free-as-in-speech, and designed to be extended and modified to suit your needs - like a hacker's assistant should be.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n(Tested using node v0.10)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/xiproject/zeus # Get the code\r\n$ ./scripts/update.sh # Fetch git submodules and npm modules\r\n$ ./scripts/run.sh # Good to go!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to pretty print the error logs, get [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan). For example,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./scripts/run.sh | bunyan\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Input\r\nFor speech-to-text, install the [Chrome app](#). This uses Google speech-to-text. The CLI is very handy too.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./scripts/cli.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Things you should know\r\n\r\nAs your personal assistant, Zeus is privy to a lot of information about you. You should understand what happens to this data and the security implications of using Zeus.\r\n\r\n- Zeus is still in development, and is rough around the edges. It has no security. Don't run it on a network you don't trust.\r\n- Zeus accesses your camera and microphone to get information about you and your surroundings. The camera feed is never sent to any other server. The microphone feed is sent to Google for speech-to-text through the Chrome app.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nMade by Vikrant Varma (@amrav) and Mihir Rege (@geremih) using the [Xi framework](http://xiproject.github.io).
